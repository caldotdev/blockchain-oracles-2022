# ðŸŒ³ Design Pattern

### Request-response

- data space to huge to be stored in smart-contract
- users only need small data subset at a time
- off-chain infrastructure monitors on-chain smart-contract calls
- common in client-server architectures
- allows for two-way communication

<v-click>

*e.g. synchronize interest rate of a smart bond daily*

</v-click>

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as Smart-Contract
    participant O as Oracle
    participant S as Off-Chain Source

    D-->>O: queries
    Note over O: parse query & check auth
    O-->>S: 
    S->>O: retrieve data
    Note over O: encrypt & sign transaction
    O->>D: broadcast
    Note over O: schedule further actions
```

# ðŸŒ³ Design Pattern

### Publish-subscribe
- effectively provides data broadcast service
  - *think of a RSS feed*
  - data is expected to change
- subscribers can either
  - poll for information with smart-contract
  - listen for changes via off-chain daemon

<v-click>

*e.g. average temperature in Germany*

</v-click>

::right::

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Smart-Contract 1
    participant O as Oracle
    participant B as Smart-Contract 2

    Note over O: supplies information to every subscriber
    A-->>O: subscribes to publish events
    B->>O: polls data
    O-->>B: data
```

# ðŸŒ³ Design Pattern

### Immediate-read

- provide data necessary for immediate decision
  - *is this student enrolled?*
- most of the times queried in a *JIT* manner
- attractive to companies that would otherwise need to supply their own infrastructure
- often stored in contract storage
  - stored on chain
  - less gas fee intensive

*e.g. an oracle to for certificates of past academic achievements*

</v-click>

::right::

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Smart-Contract
    participant C as Oracle Contract
    participant O as Oracle

    O->>C: Stores
    S-->>C: fetches
    Note left of C: on-chain transaction
    C->>S: delivers data
```

<!-- 
academic certificates, dial codes, institutional memberships, airport identifiers, self-sovereign IDs
