# Motivation

- dApps need to be able to interact with real-world events
- blockchain systems need to be able to access existing data sources, legacy systems and advanced computations
- enable *any blockchain* to create *any output* with **any input**
- **BASICALLY:** ***We need to get data on the chain â›“***
